This looks like a great resume. There were only a couple of small changes I would recommend. On the second point under student data analyst I would fix it so that it says make informed decisions instead of inform decisions. You talked about several skills you have such as Power BI and R. I would put a section near the beginning that has a comprehensive list of your skills and support it in you other sections.

I like in your resume how you had a section for projects and a section for related work experience seperate. I think that would be a good thing to do on mine.
